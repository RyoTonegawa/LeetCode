1. General Binary Tree:

Structure: Each node can have 0, 1, or 2 child nodes.
No Additional Constraints: There are no restrictions on the values of the nodes or their arrangement.
Ordering: No inherent ordering property; the values can be arranged arbitrarily.

2. Binary Search Tree (BST):

Structure: Still a binary tree (each node has up to two children).
Ordering Property:
For any given node, all values in the left subtree are less than that node’s value.
All values in the right subtree are greater than that node’s value.
In-order Traversal: Produces a sorted list of values (ascending order).

3. Complete Binary Tree:

Structure: All levels are completely filled except possibly the last.
Last Level Filling: In the last level, nodes are filled from left to right without gaps.
Usage: Often used in heaps, array-based tree representations, and scenarios where minimal height is desired.
